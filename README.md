# Newberry - a modular Sass project

This is a one-page site to practice writing a complete site from scratch using mostly familiar tools.
 
##Goals

Use Sass watch from the command line to compile css
* Incorporate extends/placeholders, mixins, variables, and nested styles
* Variables for color names, font stacks, asset paths
* Mixins for font-face and general text
* Media queries with variables for breakpoints

##Tools

* Terminal
* Sublime Text 3
* Chrome DevTools
* Photoshop

The style guide shows color swatches for visual aid in design. I used the online tool to select values and name colors:

### Other goals

* Troubleshooting
* Use command line rather than an app compiler.
* Write logical code from the start rather than maintaining a system developed by someone else.
